# OBLIVION

oblivion project is a broche with led.

the project start after i saw the oblivion movie, and really loved the props, one of them was simply a mettalic broche on their jackets [insert image here]

so i decided to make a similare broche minimal but with LED ! :p 

the perfect version of this will have apa102 2020-rgb led
a touch sensor for changing color mode 
the Âµc part is on a second pcb inside the jacket (keeping the minimal appareance outside)
a rechearging case (airpod style) 

for the Version 0.1 
it's 
charlieplexing white led
one pcb
pogopin ready.

-this project should make me back on my feet on electronics and design.
